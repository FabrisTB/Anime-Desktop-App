# Anime-Desktop-App

The purpose of this app is to learn a new language! (C#) And learn about why C# may be better or worse than other languages. Additionally, I will use it to aquire some more programming standards and techniques.

Anime-Desktop-App is first and foremost a wrapper client for MyAnimeList.net. It will allow the user to do everything a user can do on the web version of the application but through the desktop experience (because we all know desktop is superior).

Additionally, there will be support for directly streaming anime through the app, skipping filler episodes, and skipping the intro/outro.
